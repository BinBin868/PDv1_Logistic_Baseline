# PDv1_Logistic_Baseline
This repository demonstrates a **production-style Probability of Default (PD) modeling workflow** for credit risk roles, covering the full lifecycle:
**train → calibrate → score → report → governance**.

The project is designed to reflect how a baseline PD model is built, validated, and documented in real-world banking/fintech environments, with emphasis on **calibration sanity, reproducibility, and model controls**, not just predictive performance.

📄 Model documentation: see `MODEL_CARD.md` for risk intent, validation, and limitations.
